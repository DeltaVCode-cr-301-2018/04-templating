**Today, John and Dylan paired together. It took about 2 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on putting in the template from yesterday into today inside a <script> tag.
  2. Next, we linked the template to the blogArticles so we could have them show in the article.
  3. Then we got the handlebar and the html to compile and render onto the page.
  4. After that, we worked on getting the pull down tabs to show and the url to connect.
